I started my RA position at Duke's [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)](https://ece.duke.edu/) under the supervision of prof. Vahid Tarokh (ECE, Duke University). The research topics include radar signal processing, statistical methods for radar object detection, cluster analysis, and applications of deep learning in radar engineering.
