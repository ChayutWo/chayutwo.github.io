I started my data scientist position at the [Kasikorn Business-Technology Group (KBTG)](https://www.kbtg.tech). 
My main contribution would be to provide technical advice to the data science team. 
Currently, my team goal is to develop a better alternative credit scoring mechanism for [Kasikornbank](https://www.kasikornbank.com/en/personal).
