I’m thrilled to share that I’ve been promoted to Team Leader of Data Scientists at KBTG. 
I’m incredibly grateful for this opportunity and excited to lead such a talented group of professionals. 
Looking forward to driving impactful data-driven solutions and taking on new challenges together.

My team is currently working on many fascinating products including [K Plus](https://www.kasikornbank.com/en/kplus/), 
[MAKE by KBank](https://makebykbank.kbtg.tech/en), and [K-Property](https://www.kasikornbank.com/th/propertyforsale).

Alongside this, I’m also working as a technical expert on a dynamic pricing research project with a research team from 
Thammasat University and providing advice on a fraud detection project with Kasikorn Bank.
