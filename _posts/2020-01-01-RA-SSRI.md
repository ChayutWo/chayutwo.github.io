I start my RA position at the [Social Science Research Institute (SSRI)](https://ssri.duke.edu/) under the supervision of prof. Olanrewaju M. Akande (SSRI and Statistical Science, Duke University). The research topics include Bayesian nonparametric methods for missing data imputation, Dirichlet process mixture models and their applications.
